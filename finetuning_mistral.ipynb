They started me on Byetta mid-August.  After getting used to the nausea, the 5 mcg dose was fine (started 8/4/2011).  I switched to the 10 mcg dose one month and once again spent 3-4 weeks dealing with almost crippling nausea that not only made me sick, but worsened my panic problems.  I stuck through it though because I could see the changes in my blood sugar. Yesterday 12/26/11 A1C is 5.5 and I have lost 25 lbs.

I am a type 1 diabetic and my blood sugar average in the past 10 days has been 110. I have a CGM so I have had 2880 readings in the past 10 days.  A 110 average equals to an A1C of 5.45. This is possible because Afrezza mimics the speed of a healthy pancreas. Afrezza starts working in only 12-15 minutes and works out of my system very quickly. This allows me to manage my glucose in real time without babysitting diabetes all day. Even if I do have a high I can knock my sugars back to 100 in a matter of minutes.\" have GT Positive and predict Positive\n"

Avoid red meat, sausages and pies; fruit, vegetables and salad; potato skins or fries, wholemeal or brown bread; nuts, pulses, baked beans; wholemeal pasta, brown rice; puddings containing fruit or nuts; cakes and biscuits, yoghurts. Preferred are white skinless meat like chicken, grilled or poached fish, cheese, eggs; white bread, pasta, rice; boiled or mashed potatoes, water, fizzy drinks, fruit squash (not blackcurrant), clear soups, tea or coffee, shredless marmalade or jam, ice cream, custard, clear jelly, butter, margarine. \n",

On each occasion I was also to take 500ml of clear water AND to take some sugary drinks to maintain blood sugar levels &ndash; non-diet carbonated drinks i.e. Coca Cola, Lucozade, or ginger ale, any other clear sugary fluids such as clear apple juice (but NOT other fruit juices); water alone not being sufficient.

Starting at 7am the fourth dose was finished at 8pm. The drug started having an effect at about 7.45pm and thereafter it was a matter of getting to the lavatory frequently and quickly for about 3 to 4 hours. I went to bed at midnight but had to get up again at 2am and two more occasions up to 4am; though not in so much of a hurry. I took the 500ml of water after the final dose and about 250ml of Lucozade after that.  I was also told to use, what we in the UK, call vaseline to prevent soreness of skin on the buttocks. This I did not do but regretted it. Just before midnight I was so sore that I did apply some vaseline ready for Thursday morning and it paid dividends. \n",

Tramadol is the best DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, MILD PAIN MEDICINE EVER. This actually is better than everything without the high. If you actually wanna be a happy person without being high, this is it. 50 mg am- optional second until next day. Forget the critics. I would say this is like adderal, without the hunger side effects, lack of sleep, personality disorder, grumpyness, depression, etc etc etc. The best thing about it is the government is only selling it for $4 dollars. You don&#039;t even need health insurance.\" have GT Positive and predict Positive\n"
